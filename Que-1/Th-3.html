<!--  What are the advantages of using React.js in web development?  -->

1. Component-Based Architecture:-
    React allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state.

    These components can be reused across the application, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.


2. Virtual DOM for Performance:-
    React uses a Virtual DOM to optimize rendering.

    It updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed, improving app performance and speed.


3. Fast Rendering:-
    Because of its Virtual DOM and efficient diffing algorithms, React provides faster rendering compared to traditional DOM manipulation.


4. Unidirectional Data Flow:-
    React enforces one-way data binding, which makes it easier to debug and understand how data flows through the application.


5. Rich Ecosystem and Community:-
    React has a vast ecosystem including libraries for routing (React Router), state management (Redux, Zustand, Recoil), and more.

    A large community means more tutorials, third-party tools, and support.


6. JSX - JavaScript + HTML:-
    React uses JSX, which allows writing HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript.

    This makes the code more readable and easier to understand, especially for UI development.
