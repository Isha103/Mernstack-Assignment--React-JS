<!-- Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and 
component- based architecture.  -->

1. Component-Based Architecture
Definition: In React, the UI is built using components, which are independent, reusable pieces of code.

Structure: Each component can have its own state and logic, and can be nested, managed, and combined to create complex UIs.

Example: A webpage might have components like <Header>, <Navbar>, <Content>, and <Footer>, each responsible for a part of the UI.

Benefits:

Reusability

Maintainability

Clear separation of concerns

2. Virtual DOM
Definition: The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model).

How it works:

React keeps a copy of the DOM in memory (the virtual DOM).

When a component's state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it to the previous one.

React calculates the minimal number of changes (diffing algorithm) and updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM.

Benefits:

Improves performance by reducing expensive direct DOM manipulations.

Makes updates more predictable and efficient.
