<!--  What is JSX in React.js? Why is it used?  -->

JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is commonly used with React.js. It allows developers to write HTML-like code
within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize the structure of user interfaces.

Key Features of JSX:
    1. HTML-like Syntax: JSX allows you to write elements and components in a syntax that resembles HTML, which can make the code more readable and intuitive. 

    2. JavaScript Expressions: You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX by using curly braces {}. This allows for dynamic content rendering.

    3. Component Integration: JSX makes it easy to integrate React components, allowing you to compose complex UIs from smaller, reusable pieces.

    4. Compile Time: JSX is not valid JavaScript by itself; it needs to be transpiled (usually by tools like Babel) into regular JavaScript 
    function calls (e.g., React.createElement) before it can be executed by the browser.

Why is JSX Used?
    1.Readability: JSX provides a clear and concise way to describe the UI structure, making it easier for developers to understand the layout and components at a glance.

    2.Declarative Nature: It allows developers to write declarative code, meaning you can describe what the UI should look like for a given state, rather than how to achieve that state.

    3.Enhanced Developer Experience: With JSX, developers can leverage the full power of JavaScript, including variables, functions, and control structures, while still maintaining a clear structure for the UI.

    4.Tooling Support: Many modern development tools and editors provide better support for JSX, including syntax highlighting, linting, and auto-completion, which can enhance productivity.
